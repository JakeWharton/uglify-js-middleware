Uglify JS Middleware
====================

This library is an extension for the [Uglify JS][1] library to add middleware
for simple use with the [Connect][2] library to automatically uglify your JS
whenever a source file has been updated.

You can install the library through the Node Package Manager by running
`npm install uglify-js-middleware`.

    var uglify = require('uglify-js');
    require('uglify-js-middleware');
    
    //app setup...
    
    app.use(uglify.middleware({
      src : __dirname + '/public/javascripts',
      uglyext: 1
    }));

If you are not already using `uglify`, the `require()` of this library will
return the middleware function directly.

Once in place, you can now develop pretty source.js code and call source.ugly.js within the html script tag to generate and serve 'uglify' -ed javascript.

Configuration
-------------

The following options are supported:

 * `src`: Source directory of JavaScript files.
 * `dest`: Destination directory to place uglified files. If omitted, this will
   default to match `src` and your generated files will be suffixed with
   `.ugly.js` rather than just `.js`.
 * `force`: Boolean indicating whether to force uglification to occur on every
   access.
 * `mangle`: Boolean indicating whether variable names should be mangled.
 * `squeeze`: Boolean indicating whether the code should be squeezed.
 * `uglyext`: Boolean indicating whether to use the `.ugly.js` extension for
   generated files.
